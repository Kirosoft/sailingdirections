# CHAPTER 2 \- NORTH PART OF GULF OF MAINE

## GENERAL INFORMATION

Scope of the chapter

2.1 The area covered by this chapter comprises the coast of Maine from Great Wass Island (442900N 673550W) to Monhegan Island (434590N 691880W), 85 miles WSW. The description includes the ports of Bar Harbor (2.36) and Searsport (2.142). The chapter is divided into the following sections:  
Great Wass Island to Isle au Haut (2.2).  
Penobscot Bay and approaches (2.65).

## GREAT WASS ISLAND TO ISLE AU HAUT

### GENERAL INFORMATION

2.2 Area covered

This section describes the coastal and offshore route from Great Wass Island (442900N 673550W) to Isle au Haut (440300N 683750W), 50 miles SW. Also described are the anchorages at Bar Harbor (2.36) used by cruise vessels.  
It is arranged as follows:  
Great Wass Island to Petit Manan Island (2.7).  
Petit Manan Island to Isle au Haut (2.18).  
Frenchman Bay and adjacent waters (2.25).  
Blue Hill Bay and adjacent waters (2.46).

2.3 Topography

The coast of Maine between Great Wass Island and Isle au Haut (2.83), 50 miles SW, is generally rocky and indented by bays and broken by numerous  
islands. Amongst these islands are inshore passages,much used by shallow--draught vessels as they afford shelter and anchorage in adverse weather. Many of the bays make excellent anchorages.  
In its W part, this coast forms a large bight between Schoodic Head (442100N 680320W) and Isle au Haut, the centre being occupied by Mount Desert Island, which divides the bight into Frenchman Bay to the E, and Blue Hill Bay with Jericho Bay, to  
the W.  
Mount Desert Island (442050N 681800W) is mountainous and the highest feature on the coast of Maine. Its summits are rounded and several are nearly the same height, making it difficult to identify individual summits from a distance. Cadillac Mountain (2.25) is the highest peak. Other features that are prominent are Pigeon Hill (2.17), Schoodic Head and Isle au Haut.

2.4 Vertical datums and depths

Depths on Chart 4746 are reduced to Chart Datum which is approximately the level of LAT. Depths on Chart 2492 are reduced to Chart Datum which is the level of MLLW in US waters.

2.5 Dangers

Off--lying dangers extend up to 5 miles offshore from salient points in the E part of the area, and up to 10 miles off in the W part. Mount Desert Rock (2.20), the outermost danger, is isolated and lies 23 miles S of Schoodic Head.

Caution. Many dangers on this coast rise abruptly from deep water, and sounding does not generally indicate their proximity until it is too late to avoid them.

2.6 Tidal streams

Tidal streams E of Mount Desert Rock are stronger than those farther W, and are more regular and conform more exactly to the rise and fall of the tides.

## GREAT WASS ISLAND TO PETIT MANAN ISLAND

### General information

2.7 Description

The following paragraphs describe the coastal passage between Great Wass Island (442900N 673550W) and Petit Manan Island (2.9), 13 miles SW, and the inshore waters that lie between these two islands.

### Western Bay and west part of Moosabec Reach

2.10 General information

Western Bay, which is entered between Pond Point (442690N 673522W) and Nash Island (2.14), 7 miles W, is obstructed with a number of groups of islands and rocks, which lie mainly in a N--S direction. Between these groups are passages, available to mariners with local knowledge, which lead to the W entrance of Moosabec Reach. For details of the E  
part of Moosabec Reach, E of the bridge, see Nova Scotia and Bay of Fundy Pilot.  
2 On the E side of the entrance to the bay, Fisherman Island (442685N 673660W) and Browney Island (442772N 673712W) lie on foul ground extending 21⁄2 miles N from Crumple Island (2.9). A line of above and below--water rocks extends  
NE from Browney Island to Great Wass Island. In the central part of the bay Outer Sand Island (442773N 674032W), 13 m (43 ft) in height and wooded, lies 2 miles W of Browney Island. Inner Sand Island (442830N 674045W), Drisko Island (442875N 674038W) and Stevens Island (442945N 674014W) form a group of wooded islands that lie on foul ground that extends N from Outer Sand Island in the central part of Western Bay, 3 miles W of Great Wass Island.  
On the W side of the bay Black Rock (442625N 674275W), Flat Island (442756N 674239W),  
Green Island (442919N 674243W), both low and grassy, Plummer Island (442916N 674185W), wooded, and Ram Island (442948N 674235W), not to be confused with a larger island of the same name 3 miles E (2.11), lie in a N--S direction about 11⁄2 miles W of the islands in the centre of the bay. Flat Island is separated from the other islands by a channel and the group is separated from Moose Neck (443030N 674280W), on the mainland NW, by Tibbett Narrows (2.12).

2.11 Passages

Ram Island. The passage that leads between Ram Island (442947N 673786W), not to be confused with a smaller island of the same name 3 miles W (2.10), and Stevens Island (2.10), though wide in its S part, is restricted by foul ground in its N part and is consequently only available to mariners with local knowledge.

2.12 Directions

West approach to Moosabec Reach. The W end of Moosabec Reach can be approached either through the passage that leads between Outer Sand Island, Drisko Island and Stevens Island on the E and Flat Island and Plummer Island on the W, or through Tibbett Narrows (442960N 674243W). Tibbett Narrows is a narrow channel, the NE entrance of which is marked by No 27 Light Buoy (port hand) and No 28 Buoy (starboard hand), leading between Tibbett Island (442970N 674275W) and Ram Island (442948N 674235W) (2.10). These narrows are  
3⁄4 cable wide at the narrowest part with a least depth of 11 m (36 ft).  
Caution. There are patches, with depths of 82 and 76 m (27 and 25 ft), 31⁄2 cables ENE and 3 cables ENE of the E point of Tibbett Island. West part of Moosabec Reach. From a position  
NE of Shabbit Island (443038N 674104W) the track through the W part of Moosabec Reach, which is marked by light buoys (lateral), leads ENE, passing:  
3 SSE of the entrance to Wohoa Bay (443150N 674100W), into which flow West River and Indian River, thence:  
NNW of Shabbit Island Ledge (443070N 674044W), which dries 34 m (11 ft) and is marked by No 23 Buoy (port hand), thence:  
4 Between Fessenden Ledge (443110N 673997W) and the N point of Hardwood Island. The former dries 03 m (1 ft) and is marked by No 22 Light Buoy (starboard hand).  
The latter is wooded and has a house on its N point. A shoal, marked by No 21 Buoy (port  
hand), extends 3 cables NE from the island.  
Thence:  
5 Between No 20 Buoy (starboard hand) and Pomp Island (443110N 673997W), wooded. No 4 Beacon marks a rock 11⁄2 cables W of the N point of Pomp Island.  
Thence to Beals Island Bridge (443148N 673688W), spanning Moosabec Reach, linking  
Jonesport to Beals. For further details of this area see  
Nova Scotia and Bay of Fundy Pilot.

2.13 Anchorage

Wohoa Bay. Good anchorage may be obtained in the entrance to Wohoa Bay in 4 to 11 m (13 to 36 ft) between Fessenden Ledge (2.12) and Carrying Place  
Island, 11⁄4 miles W.

### Anchorages and harbours

2.14 Pleasant Bay

**Description**. Pleasant Bay (442995N 674666W), entered between Flint Island (442860N 674725W) and Nash Island, 13⁄4 miles ESE, is a secure anchorage. There are numerous islands and reefs in the bay but important dangers are buoyed. A channel, not less than 5 cables wide with a least depth of 11 m (36 ft), leads up the bay to an anchorage.  
Navigation at night. As there are no lighted aids to navigation N of Nash Island, a vessel should not enter the harbour at night. Navigation in the bay should present no difficulty by day in good visibility. Ice obstructs navigation in the Pleasant River from December to April. In ordinary winters, ice that forms in the bay is swept out by the tide.  
**Directions**. From a position SW of Nash Island (442785N 674475W) the route to the anchorages in Pleasant Bay leads N, passing:  
W of NI Light Buoy (safe water) (442786N 674548W). The tower of a disused lighthouse stands on the W end of Nash Island. Thence:  
4 W of Pot Rock (442877N 674507W), which is 18 m (6 ft) in height and bare, and:  
E of Coles Ledge (442874N 674652W) which is 3 cables E of Flint Island (442860N 674725W), a wooded island 23 m (76 ft) in height and wildlife sanctuary. The ledge is marked by C1 Buoy (port hand). Thence:  
5 Between Norton Island Ledge (442967N 674580W) and the E extremity of Dyer  
Island (442992N 674842W), 11⁄4 miles W. Dyer Island is separated from Flint Island to the S by Flint Island Narrows (442884N 674770W), a deep but narrow passage 1 cable wide, the S side of which is marked by C1 Buoy (port hand). The passage should not be used without local knowledge. Thence proceed as necessary to the anchorages.  
**Anchorages**.  The best anchorage in 4 to 5 m (13 to 16 ft), which is used most frequently, is situated SE and E of Birch Islands (443200N 674580W), 4 miles N of Nash Island.  
Anchorage may also be found in 9 to 11 m (30 to 36 ft), W of Nightcap Island (443119N 674555W), 31⁄2 miles N of Nash Island. In an emergency at night, anchorage may be obtained 21⁄4 miles NNW of Nash Island, close inside the entrance to the bay, in 18 m (59 ft).

2.15 Harrington Bay

**Description**. Harrington Bay (443200N 674860W), which is entered from the NW side of  
Pleasant Bay, is separated from the upper part of that bay on the E by Ripley Neck (443200N 674750W), and from Narraguagus Bay (2.16) on the W by Foster Island (443170N 674985W). The bay extends 21⁄2 miles N from Strout Island (443096N  
674825W), a wooded island which lies in the middle of its entrance. Harrington River enters the N end of the bay. Ice very frequently forms in Harrington River and Bay between December and April as far down as Ripley Neck.  
**Directions**. The main channel leads W of Strout Island through Strout Island Narrows (443090N 674843W), which has a depth of about 10 m (33 ft),  
keeping clear of an awash rock (443107N 674861W) marked by Strout Island Buoy (preferred channel to starboad). Dyer Island Narrows (443085N 674940W), which has a depth of 24 m (8 ft), leads N of Dyer Island from Harrington Bay to Narraguagus Bay (2.16).  
The passage is buoyed but there are numerous dangers near to the fairway and the channel should not be used without local knowledge.  
**Anchorage** may be obtained in 9 to 14 m (30 to 46 ft) on the E side of the bay, but the bay is seldom used except by local vessels.

2.16 Narraguagus Bay

**Description**. Narraguagus Bay (443020N 674990W) is entered between Bois Bubert Island  
(442620N 675200W) and Flint Island (2.14), 4 miles SW. It is a well sheltered anchorage, used year--round as a harbour of refuge by vessels up to 55 m (18 ft) draught, which anchor in the lower part of the bay. A number of islands and rocks lie in the entrance  
to the bay.   
**Directions**. From a position SSE of Flint Island the  
route to the anchorages in Narraguagus Bay leads  
NW, passing:  
NE of Black Ledge (442638N 674863W), which dries 34 m (11 ft). This ledge is the N extremity of Jordans Delight Ledge (442600N 674893W). Thence:  
NE of Mackerel Rock (442691N 674826W), an unmarked rock with a depth of 3 m (10 ft),  
thence:NE of Pond Island (442750N 675020W) witha bare conical hill 48 m (158 ft) in height. A disused lighthouse (white tower) 55 m (18 ft) in height, stands on its E extremity and is prominent from E and S. No 1 Light Buoy (port hand) is moored off this point. Thence:  
SW of Shipstern Island (442840N 674810W), 29 m (95 ft) in height and, wooded with rocky bluffs on its S side, thence:  
Either side of Trafton Island (442905N 674980W), 26 m (85 ft) in height and wooded. The E channel, 5 cables wide, separates Trafton Island from Tommy Island (442903N 674890W) and Western Reef (442866N 674883W). The S extremity of Western Reef is marked by No 2 Buoy (starboard hand).  
Thence to the anchorages and the entrance to the  
Narraguagus River.  
**Caution**. The vicinity of Black Ledge should be avoided as the bottom is very irregular and other dangers may exist.  
**Anchorage** for vessels seeking shelter is usually obtained in 6 m (20 ft) between Trafton Island and No 5 Buoy (port hand) marking Lower Middle Ground (442985N 675078W), 1 mile NW. Good anchorage may also be obtained 4 cables NE of No 6 Beacon, marking Trafton Halftide Ledge (442991N 675010W). Vessels up to 3 m (10 ft) draught sometimes  
anchor, in 4 to 5 m (13 to 16 ft), between Trafton Island and Trafton Halftide Ledge, 1 mile N.  
Vessels bound for Narraguagus River (443158N 675160W) anchor, in 4 to 6 m (13 to 20 ft), cables E of Mitchell Point (443060N 675135W).  
Anchorage may also be obtained in 7 to 11 m (23 to 36 ft) in Douglas Island Harbor (442780N 675110W), which is formed by Pond Island, Douglas Islands (442700N 675100W), the N part of Bois Bubert Island and the mainland NW. It is seldom used  
as the anchorage above Trafton Island is better and a considerable sea enters the harbour between the Douglas Islands in heavy S weather.

2.17 Pigeon Hill Bay

**Description**. The entrance to Pigeon Hill Bay (442550N 675280W) lies between the S end of Bois Bubert Island (2.16) and Petit Manan Point, 21⁄2 miles SW. The bay is easy of access by day and affords good anchorage.  
**Directions**. From a position N of Petit Manan Light (442206N 675186W) (2.8) the route to the anchorages in Pigeon Hill Bay leads NNW, passing:  
WSW of Whale Ledge (442388N 675194W), which dries 18 m (6 ft) and is marked on its S  
side by No 4 Buoy (starboard hand), thence:  
WSW of Egg Rock (442440N 675212W), 5 m in height and consisting of a ledge of dark boulders, parts of which are dry. There is a narrow unmarked channel for small vessels between Egg Rock and Bois Bubert Island, the use of which requires local knowledge.  
Thence:  
ENE of Wood Pond Point (442452N 675340W), from which a bank with depths of 21 to 52 m (7 to 17 ft) extends 81⁄2 cables SSE, thence: WSW of Gull Rocks (442585N 675255W), which dry 18 m (6 ft).   
Thence to the anchorage.  
**Useful mark**:  
Pigeon Hill (442730N 675337W), a bare--topped hill, 97 m (318 ft) in height, standing on the W side of the head of the bay.  
**Channel**. A narrow channel leads from the head of the bay to Douglas Island Harbor (2.16). Local knowledge is necessary to use this channel.  
Anchorage may be obtained in 4 to 7 m (13 to 23 ft), clear of a cable area running through the centre of the bay, but is seldom used except by local  
Fishermen.   
**Caution**. Fish weirs extend from either side of the bay.

(Directions continue for coastal passage at 2.74, for East Penobscot Bay at 2.85, and for West Penobscot Bay at 2.112)

### Anchorages and harbours 

2.21 Dyer Bay

**Description**. Dyer Bay (442660N 675520W) affords good anchorage, but the dangers in it are unmarked and it is seldom used except by small local vessels. It is entered 3¼ miles NW of Petit Manan Light (2.8) between Petit Manan Point (442370N 675398W) and Dyer Point (442471N 675593W), 1¾ miles NW. Bonney Chess Ledge (442439N 675542W) and The Castle (442439N 675517W), groups of rocks with passages between them, lie in the entrance to the bay.  
**Tidal streams** in the entrance are strong but follow the direction of the channel except near Dyer Point where they set into Gouldsboro Bay (2.22).   
**Directions**. Vessels entering the bay should pass about 2¼ cables E of The Castle (2.21) and proceed up Dyer Bay in mid--channel.   
There should be no difficulty for a vessel to enter by day with good visibility, but no vessel with a draught of over 24 m (8 ft) should attempt to enter at LW without local knowledge.   
The channel through the bay narrows to a width of 1½ cables between shoals which extend from Stanley Point (442524N 675564W) on the W side, and Yellow Birch Head (442507N 675473W) on the E side of the bay, 1 mile N of the entrance. Then it widens to 5 cables, before reducing to 2 cables abreast Sheep Island (442763N 675491W).   
**Caution** should be exercised as there are several fish weirs, which are covered at or near HW, in the bay.   
**Anchorage** should be selected near the middle of the bay, not less than 1¼ miles above The Castle, in 6 to 13 m (20 to 43 ft), but not more than 2½ cables above Sheep Island (3 miles N of the entrance). 

2.22 Gouldsboro Bay

**Description**. Gouldsboro Bay (442540N 675770W), which provides good anchorage, is entered 4 miles NW of Petit Manan Light (2.8) between Dye r Point (2.21) and Youngs Point (442397N 675759W), 1¼ miles SW.   
Sally Islands (442406N 675677W) are a chain of islands and rocks that lie across the entrance to Gouldsboro Bay. Eastern Way and Western Passage are the two navigable channels leading through the Sally Islands into the bay. These passages are not easy to identify when approaching from the W.   
**Ice** obstructs navigation in Gouldsboro Bay from December to March and in severe winters the bay is completely closed.   
**Directions**. Eastern Way (442418N 675648W) leads between Eastern Island (442425N 675619W) and Bald Rock (442415N 675669W), 3 cables W. The passage is ¾ cable wide with a depth of 134 m (44 ft). Depths of 54 m (18 ft) extend up to 1¼ cables from the islands on either side of the channel. Vessels should pass midway between Eastern Island and Bald Rock.   
**Caution**. The tidal streams set strongly across this channel with the flood tide setting NE and the ebb SW.   
Western Passage leads between Sally Island (442406N 675677W) and Sheep Island (442385N 675731W),   
cables WSW. The passage has a least depth of 60 m (20 ft) and is ½ cable wide. Vessels should pass close along the E side of Sheep Island and W of the drying ledges that extend 2½ cables W of Sally Island.   
**Tidal streams** follow the channel at a maximum rate of between 2 and 3 kn.   
**Caution**. This passage should not be attempted without local knowledge.   
**Useful mark**: Point Francis (high and wooded) (442685N 675894W). This point, 3¼ miles above Youngs Point, can be clearly seen from the entrance of the bay.   
**Anchorage** can be obtained anywhere between the entrance and Point Francis, not less than 2½ cables from the shore. 

2.23 Prospect Harbor  
**Description**. Prospect Harbor, 4½ miles NNE of Schoodic Island (2.20), is entered between Cranberry Point (442312N 675900W) and Spruce Point (442141N 680165W). The outer harbour has ample depth and affords anchorage for large vessels, but is exposed to S and SE winds. It is easily entered through the channels that lead on either side of the dangers off the entrance.   
Prospect Harbor Point (442420N 680075W), 1½ miles NW of Cranberry Point, divides the head of the harbour into two coves; Inner Harbor, to the W, with the village of Prospect Harbor at its head, and Sand Cove, to the NE. The approaches to Prospect Harbor are obstructed by a group of rocky patches.   
**Ice** seldom obstructs the harbour.  
**Directions from east**. From a position SE of Cranberry Point the E approach to Prospect Harbor leads NW, within the white sector (317--323) of Prospect Harbor Point Light (white conical tower, 12 m in height) (442420N 680078W), passing:

## FRENCHMAN BAY AND ADJACENT WATERS 

### General information 

2.25 Description 

Frenchman Bay (442600N 681150W), lies between Schoodic Peninsula and the E side of Mount Desert Island. From its entrance between Schoodic Point (2.30) and Baker Island (2.30), the bay is 12 miles long and 4 miles wide to its head, which is divided into several arms. It is rocky, but the water is deep and generally free from dangers except near its shores.   
The bay is divided halfway up by the Porcupine Islands (442440N 680975W), a group of islands which extend across the bay and have two good channels leading between them to the upper part of the bay.   
Cadillac Mountain (442108N 681359W), the summit of Mount Desert Island, is the highest point on the coast of Maine and in clear weather is visible between 35 and 45 miles. However it should be noted that there are several peaks on the island of nearly the same elevation, making it difficult to identify individual peaks. 

2.26 **Recommended routes** 

Deep--draught vessels, high--speed ferries and other commercial vessels transiting through Frenchman Bay are requested to follow the charted recommended routes. These routes have been established to provide safe passage for increased commercial traffic and to prevent the loss of fishing gear placed in the approaches to, and within, Frenchman Bay. 

2.27 Pilotage

Pilotage is compulsory for all foreign vessels and US vessels under register in foreign trade, with a draught of 27 m (9 ft) or more. The pilot boards in position 441810N 680399W or 441611N 680789W. See ADMIRALTY List of Radio Signals Volume 6(5) for details. 

2.28 Natural conditions 

**Local magnetic anomaly**. The normal magnetic variation is increased/decreased by 3 in the vicinity of Jordan Island (2.42).   
**Ice**. During mild winters Frenchman Bay is usually clear of ice to Skillings River (442970N 681600W), but the bays and rivers opening into the N part of the bay are frozen over. Winter Harbor (2.41) is seldom closed by ice.   
**Fog**. It is reported that during foggy weather Frenchman Bay usually clears of fog during the day, although it may remain thick outside the harbour entrance.

No 5 Buoy (port hand) is moored at the edge of foul ground that extends 3 cables NE from Bar Island, and Nos 6 and 8 Buoys (starboard hand) mark the N and W limits of Cow and Calf Ledge (441710N 682972W) which extends from the NW end of Tinker Island. A channel 1¾ cables wide, the centre of which is marked by T1 Buoy (safe water) and with a depth of 51 m (17 ft), crosses the shoal ground between Bar Island and Trumpet Island.   
Thence most vessels proceeding to the N part of the bay follow the route between Tinker Island and Hardwood Island (441630N 682880W) and thence between Long Island (442100N 683030W) and Bartlett Island (442100N 682620W). Small vessels sometimes use the more protected passage between Moose Island (441740N 682597W) and Hardwood Island.   
**Useful marks**:   
Spire in West Tremont (441580N 682362W).   
Bass Harbor Head Light (white tower and dwelling, 10 m in height) (441331N 682024W). 

### Other entrance channels

2.51 General information 

As most of the vessels navigating Blue Hill Bay do not exceed 27 m (9 ft) in draught, the bay is usually entered through one of the inshore channels described below. 

2.52 Southwest Approach 

**Description**. Southwest Approach (440670N 682340W) may be used by vessels entering Blue Hill Bay from the W.   
**Directions**. From a position SSW of Southwest Point (440590N 682204W), the approach leads N between Long Island (440680N 682121W) and Johns Island (440658N 682430W), passing between J Buoy (preferred channel to port) marking Johns Island Sunken Ledge and No 2 Buoy (starboard hand) marking Beach Ledge (440632N 682286W). It then leads between the W Sister Island (440851N 682286W) and Red Point (440854N 682359W), the SE point of Swans Island. This part of the route passes over patches with swept depths of 73 and 45 m (24 and 15 ft). From a position NW of Sister Islands, the route then leads NE to join Eastern Passage (2.50). 

2.53 Casco Passage 2.53

**Description**. Casco Passage connects Jericho Bay with Blue Hill Bay through a channel, N of Swans Island, between Orono Island (441122N 682766W) and Black Island (441210N 682764W). This passage divides into two branches in its W part, the N part continuing as Casco Passage and the S part as York Narrows.   
Both channels are well marked, and buoyed as for a passage proceeding from E to W.   
Casco Passage has a least width of ½ cable and a shallow patch of 37 m (12 ft) in the fairway, rocks lie on both sides of it.   
**York Narrows**, with a width of ½ cable and a depth of 4 m (13 ft), has dangerous rocks on either side of it and is not recommended.   
**Tidal streams** in Casco Passage set E with a rising tide and W with a falling tide. Local knowledge is required. 

2.54 Pond Island Passage

Pond Island Passage leads from Blue Hill Bay into the N part of Jericho Bay, N of Pond Island (441345N 682860W).   
The passage, which is marked by buoys, has a least depth of 57 m (19 ft) in the fairway, but shoal patches lie close by. Local knowledge is required. 

### Jericho Bay

2.55 General information 

Jericho Bay (440975N 683209W) comprises the area, 3 miles wide, between Swans Island and Marshall Island (440680N 683040W) on the E, and Isle au Haut (2.83) and Deer Isle (441250N 683950W) on the W. It is obstructed by numerous islands and shoals.   
The upper portion of the bay provides inshore navigation for local vessels between Blue Hill Bay on the E and Penobscot Bay (2.66) on the W. The lower part of the bay is little used except by local fishermen and yachts.   
Neither the bay nor its approaches should be entered without local knowledge and therefore only an outline description of this area is given. 

2.56 Passages and channels 

**South--east approach** to Jericho Bay leads from S of Johns Island Sunken Ledge (440589N 682447W), between Brimstone Island (440656N 682802W) and Green Island (440685N 682678W) and then between Marshall Island and Swans Island passing through Toothacher Bay (440750N 682870W). This passage, which is marked by buoys (lateral) enters Jericho Bay N of Halibut Rocks Light (red and white chequered diamond on framework tower) (440804N 683153W).   
**South approach**. Two entrance channels, for which local knowledge is required, lead into Jericho Bay from S between the dangers which lie between Marshall Island and Isle au Haut. Though these channels are the most direct route to the bay from the S, many dangers are unmarked and consequently the recommended channel is that from the SE through Toothacher Bay.   
**Passages to Blue Hill Bay**. See 2.53 and 2.54. 3 Merchant Row (440705N 683900W), the S of the inner channels between Jericho Bay and E Penobscot Bay, leads through the islands and shoals lying between Deer Isle (2.55) and Isle au Haut,  4 miles SSE. The channel is entered between Southern Mark Island (440721N 683434W), lying 2¾ miles W of Long Point (440764N 683045W), the N extremity of Marshall Island, and Southern Mark Island Ledge (440794N 683472W).   
This channel is used by vessels of moderate draught at all times of the year, and in winter is used by other vessels when Deer Island Thorofare is blocked by ice. Merchant Row is not quite so direct as Deer Island Thorofare, but the channel is wider and deeper. There are numerous dangers on both sides of the channel, but the principal ones are marked by buoys and beacons. The channel can easily be followed, by day, by those with local knowledge.   
**Deer Island Thorofare** (440887N 684054W) is a narrow channel along the S side of Deer Isle, between it and the numerous islands S. It is entered from the E, either S of Whaleback Ledge (440929N 683326W), thence N of Bold Island (440932N 683688W), or between Long Ledge (441081N 683282W) and Potato Ledge (441052N 683306W), 3 cables SSW.   
The passage, which connects Jericho Bay and East Penobscot Bay and is used by vessels proceeding coastwise, is marked by buoys and beacons. It has a least width of ½ cable and a least depth of 42 m (14 ft) at its W end between Moose Island (440895N 684094W) and Crotch Island (440853N 684040W).   
Vessels of up to 55 m (18 ft) draught are reported to have used the passage but many unmarked dangers, with depths of 27 to 43 m (9 to 14 ft), lie close to the channel. The channel should not be attempted without local knowledge. This channel is occasionally closed by ice which is soon broken up by icebreakers. During severe winters solid ice has formed between Stonington (2.58) and Isle au Haut. 

2.57 Eggemoggin Reach 

**Description**. Eggemoggin Reach (441630N 683800W) is the channel between the Deer Isles and the mainland N, which connects the head of Jericho Bay with Penobscot Bay, near its head. There are several villages along its shores. The reach is 11 miles long and has a least width of 4 cables near Byard Point (441783N 684110W). The Deer Isle--Sedgwick Bridge, with a vertical clearance of 259 m (85 ft) for 305 m (100 ft) either side of the centreline, spans the reach near this point, narrowing the channel to 1¾ cables.   
The main channel through the reach is generally broad and has sufficient depth for deep--draught vessels, however the channel is narrow in places and the bottom irregular and its navigation needs care. The channel is entered from the E about 1 mile SW of Mahoney Island (441303N 683072W), a position 2 miles SW and WNW of the W ends of Pond Island Passage and Casco Passage, respectively.   
The channel is marked with beacons and buoys (lateral), as for a vessel entering from the E. The principal dangers are buoyed and can easily be avoided by day in clear weather. 

2.58 Anchorages and harbours

**Burnt Coat Harbor** (440803N 682668W), on the S side of Swans Island, is entered from Toothacher Bay (2.56) between Harbor Island (440770N 682650W) and Hockamock Head (440805N 682683W), on which stands Burnt Coat Harbor Light (white square tower). The fairway in the entrance has a least width of ¼ cable and depth of 64 m (21 ft). A prominent tower is situated on the E side of the harbour, 1 mile N of the lighthouse.   
Anchorage, small but well sheltered, can be obtained E of the lighthouse in depths of 6 to 10 m (20 to 33 ft), or in the channel farther N in 4 to 7 m (13 to 23 ft). These anchorages are much used by local fishing vessels and yachts.   
**Southeast Harbor** (441195N 683800W), lying NW of the E end of Deer Island Thorofare between the W end (441157N 683600W) of Stinson Neck (441195N 683800W) and the N end (441180N 683839W) of Whitmore Neck provides the best anchorage in the vicinity of this thoroughfare.   
Anchorage may be obtained in 6 to 12 m (20 to 39 ft). Boat Rock (441078N 683528W), marked on its SE side by a buoy (preferred channel to port), lies 9 cables SE of the entrance.   
The harbour is seldom closed by ice.

A cannery wharf, with depths alongside of 21 m, extends from Staple Point (440928N 683964W) in the centre of the town. There are several wharves with depths alongside of 15 to 30 m, either side of Staple Point.   
Fuel and provisions are available.   
**Allen Cove** (440898N 684068W), situated on the E side of Moose Island, 1 mile W of Staple Point, is protected by a breakwater. A shipyard, with several piers and patent slips, for vessels up to 250 tonnes, is situated on the SE side of Moose Island. General hull and engine repairs can be carried out at the shipyard.   
**Eggemoggin Reach** (2.57). Vessels can anchor anywhere within the reach, clear of a cable area crossing the reach about 1 mile SE of Byard Point, where the depth is suitable and the bottom soft. Small vessels can anchor in the coves described as follows, all of which are on the N side of the reach:   
Benjamin River (441770N 683760W) lies close NW of Cape Carter (441680N 683754W). The entrance channel has a least depth of 57 m (19 ft) and a least width of ½ cable. A wharf with a depth alongside of 24 m is situated on the W side about 6 cables above the river entrance.   
Billings Cove (441785N 684075W) entered close E of Byard Point at the N end of the suspension bridge, provides anchorage in about 76 m (25 ft) in the middle of the cove just inside the entrance. Sargentville, a village on the E shore, has a wharf with a depth alongside of 24 m.   
**Bucks Harbor** (442020N 684455W) is an excellent anchorage often used by small vessels. Harbor Island, in the middle of the harbour, has a channel either side of it. The best anchorage is in 8 to 11 m (26 to 36 ft), W and NW of the island. South Brooksville, a village at the head of the harbour has two wharves with depths alongside of 37 m. Fuel, water and provisions are available.   
**Orcutt Harbor** (442020N 684540W) is entered W of Condon Point (441985N 684500W). It has good anchorage in the middle of the harbour in 4 to 16 m (13 to 53 ft), just above a wooded islet on the W side near the entrance. A rock, with a depth of 15 m (5 ft) lies 1 cable S of the islet. 

### Anchorages and harbours 

2.59 Bass Harbor

**Position and function**. Bass Harbor (441400N 682110W), which is entered between Bass Harbor Head (2.46) and Lopaus Point, 1 mile WNW, on the E side of the entrance to Blue Hill Bay, is an important fishing village and is sometimes used as an anchorage by coastal traffic.   
**Local weather**. The outer anchorage is exposed to the S.   
**Directions**. The outer harbour can be entered passing either side of Weaver Ledge, which lies 3 cables E of Lopaus Point (441361N 682190W). This ledge dries 09 m (3 ft) and is marked by Nos 1 and 2 Buoys (lateral) at its SE and NW extremities. The villages of Bass Harbor (E side) and Bernard (W side), in the inner harbour, are reached by a buoyed channel, with a depth (2019) of 32 m (10 ft).   
**Anchorage** may be obtained in 9 to 14 m (30 to 46 ft) in the outer harbour between Weaver Ledge and the entrance to the channel.

2.60 Mackerel Cove 

**Description**. Mackerel Cove, on the N side of Swans Island, is a good anchorage entered between North Point (441140N 682546W) and Crow Island (441128N 682627W). The village of Atlantic stands on the SE side of the cove.   
**Directions**. Although there are several dangers in the cove, it is easy to enter from N during the day. To enter the bay vessels should pass   
W of No 1 Light Buoy (port hand) that marks the ledge extending NW from North Point, thence:   
E of No 2 Buoy (starboard hand) that marks the ledge close E of Crow Island, thence:   
W of No 3 Buoy, marking a rock with a depth of 21 m (7 ft).   
**Caution**. Below--water rocks lie in the approach to the ferry pier, 5 cables S of North Point. A reported below--water rock (441100N 682580W) (position approximate) lies mid--way between Nos 2 and 3 Buoys.   
**Useful mark:**   
Church tower (441032N 682481W), situated in the village of Atlantic.   
**Anchorage** may be obtained, clear of a charted cable area, in depths of 7 to 10 m (23 to 33 ft), mud.   
**Ferry pier** is situated 5 cables S of North Point. 

2.61 Western Bay 

**Description**. Western Bay is entered between North Point (442240N 682540W), the N most point of Bartlett Island (2.50) and Oak Point (2.62), 1¼ miles N.   
**Topography**. The bay forms part of the channel which separates Mount Desert Island from the mainland and leads into Mount Desert Narrows (442580N 682200W). Alley Island, the largest in the bay, lies 1¾ miles ENE of Oak Point. Foul ground extends 2½ cables SE from the island, which is ridge.  
**Anchorage** may be obtained by vessels of all sizes in 13 to 19 m (43 to 62 ft) SW of Alley Island, but the broken rocky ground which extends 4 cables SE of Oak Point should be avoided.   
There is also anchorage in 6 to 12 m (20 to 39 ft) SE and E of Alley Island, avoiding the foul ground extending from the island. 

2.62 Union River Bay

**Description**. Union River Bay is entered between Oak Point (442380N 682550W) and High Head (442312N 682759W) on Newbury Neck, 1½ miles SW.   
**Topography**. The bay extends 5½ miles N to Weymouth Point (442900N 682625W) and is almost free of dangers except near its head where it divides into two arms; Patten Bay, the W arm which leads to the village of Surry, and Union River, the N arm, which leads to the city of Ellsworth, 3½ miles N of Weymouth Point.   
Tupper Ledge, partly awash and marked on its S side by TL Buoy (preferred channel to starboard) lies 6 cables S of Weymouth Point in the entrance to Union River.
